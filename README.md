   - **Anthropic**: Advanced reasoning with Claude models.
4. Enter your API key and select the appropriate model.
5. Start interacting with your AI assistant!

## Usage

### Basic Chat Interface

- Open the **MIS** sidebar tab.
- Input your question or command in natural language.
- Receive intelligent responses with code suggestions and explanations.

### Scenario Selection

- Select a scenario (Learning, Solution, Integration, Development, Configuration, Management) via the dropdown in the sidebar.
- The AI tailors responses to the chosen scenario, providing relevant tools and flow JSON.

### JSON/Code Handling

- Large JSON or code outputs are hidden behind a **View JSON/Code** button to keep the UI clean.
- Edit flow JSON in a built-in editor with syntax highlighting and apply changes directly.

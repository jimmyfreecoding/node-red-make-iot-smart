## Support
AI development is more like art than technology. Mastering LLMs is not a simple task and requires deep understanding of AI models, data, and application scenarios. Each Q&A session may yield different results. Initial versions are often imperfect, but with the improvement of prompt engineering, they will gradually truly meet the daily needs of Node-RED users, whether IT or OT engineers. We welcome more interested people to join the project.
